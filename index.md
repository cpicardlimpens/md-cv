<!-- ## Projects

### commons

I was member of the board of managers of one of the first coworking place in Lille, La Coroutine, for 2 years (2013-2015). This self-financed place is considered a common since it is run by the community of its users and is open to any kind of contribution. This is also where I got the chance to contribute to other commons-like projects on social projects cartography (http://imaginationforpeople.org/, http://encommuns.org) or the development of a community of hackers and DIYers in Lille (http://lille-makers.org)

### scientific mediation

As a teacher and science and philosophy , I love transmitting

### datarea

I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/education/summer-data-challenge/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account. -->
